                    <p>
                        Nandalal Bose (3 December 1882 â€“ 16 April 1966) was 
                        one of the pioneers of modern Indian art and a key 
                        figure of Contextual Modernism. A pupil of Abanindranath
                         Tagore, Bose was known for his "Indian style" of painting. 
                         He became the principal of Kala Bhavan, Santiniketan in 1921.
                          He was influenced by the Tagore family and the murals of Ajanta,
                           his classic works include paintings of scenes
                         from Indian mythologies, women, and village life.

                        <span id="moreText"> Today, many critics consider his paintings
                             among India's most important modern paintings. In 1976, the
                              Archaeological Survey of India, Department of Culture, Govt. 
                              of India declared his works among the "nine artists" whose work, 
                              "not being antiquities", were to be henceforth considered "to be 
                              art treasures, having regard to their artistic and aesthetic value". 
                            He was given the work of illustrating the constitution of India.
