                <h1>~Amrita Shergil~</h1>
            <p>
                Amrita Sher-Gil (30 January 1913 â€“ 5 December 1941) was a Hungarian-Indian painter.
                 She has been called "one of the greatest avant-garde women artists of the early
                  20th century" and a pioneer in modern Indian art. Drawn to painting from an early 
                  age, Sher-Gil started formal lessons at the age of eight. She first gained recognition 
                  at the age of 19, for her oil painting Young Girls (1932). 
                Sher-Gil depicted everyday life of the people in her paintings.

                <span id="moreText"> Sher-Gil traveled throughout her life to various countries including Turkey, France,
                     and India, deriving heavily from precolonial Indian art styles as well as contemporary culture. Sher-Gil
                      is considered an important painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands on a level with that of the
                       pioneers from the Bengal Renaissance. She was also an avid reader and a pianist. Sher-Gil's
                     paintings are among the most expensive by Indian women painters today, although few acknowledged her work when she was alive.
