                <h1>~Raja Ravi Varma~</h1>
            <p>
                He was an Indian painter and artist. He is considered among the greatest painters in the history of Indian art.
                His works are one of the best examples of the fusion of European academic art with a purely Indian sensibility 
                and iconography. Specially, he was notable for making affordable lithographs of his paintings available to the public,
                 which greatly enhanced his reach and influence as a painter and public figure.His lithographs increased the 
                involvement of common people with fine arts and defined artistic tastes among common people. Furthermore, his
                 religious depictions of Hindu deities and works from Indian epic poetry and Puranas have received profound acclaim.
                 He was part of the royal family of erstwhile Parappanad, Malappuram district.
