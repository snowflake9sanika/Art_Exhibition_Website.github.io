                <h1>~Meera Mukherjee~</h1>
            <p>Indian sculptor. Trained in a pictorial style of the Bengal School, a
                 movement favouring a return to Indian traditions in reaction to Western 
                 Academic trends, Meera Mukherjee also studied sculpture with traditional craftsmen.
                  In 1941 she enrolled in the Delhi Polytechnic College where she received her diploma 
                  in painting, graphic design and sculpture in 1951. A scholarship to the Academy of Fine Arts 
                  in Munich, led to her moving to Germany from 1953 to 1956. Here she became aware of the shortcomings of her artistic education, 
                and the distance from her home pushed her to questioning her identity. 
                <span id="points">...</span>
                <span id="moreText">Thus her stylistic and personal “search for Indianness” began. She quickly
                     dedicated herself to sculpture without completely abandoning painting and drawing. In 1956
                      she returned to Calcutta, but encouraged by an anthropologist friend, she left for Bastar 
                      in Madhya Pradesh to study the techniques particular to the Gharuan people, who use a traditional 
                      and primitive lost wax process. She was supported for several subsequent trips. Her great tour of India 
                      allowed her to work with other traditional craftsman, multiplying her sources of inspiration.
                       The sum of her research and discoveries was published in 
                    1978 under the auspices of the Anthropological Survey of India in Metalcraftsmen of India.
