                <h1>~Jamini Roy~</h1>
            <p>
                Jamini Roy was an Indian painter best known for combining traditional 
                Indian and Western art styles to create unique and complex works. Born
                 on April 11, 1887 in Beliatore, India, he went on to study under Abanindranath
                  Tagore at the Government College of Art in Kolkata at age 16. While there, 
                  he learned academic drawing and painting in the Western tradition. After 
                  graduating, Roy adopted the simple forms, flat colors, and humble paints 
                  of Bengali folk artists. The artist garnered impressive success throughout
                   his career, ultimately receiving the Padma Bhushan award from the Government of India in 1954, 
                which is the third highest honor that can bestowed upon a civilian.

                <span id="moreText"> Today, Royâ€™s works can be found in the collections of the
                     Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Harn Museum of Art at the
                      University of Florida, and the National Gallery of Modern Art in 
                    New Delhi, among others. Roy died on April 24, 1972 in Kolkata, India.
